# 🔧 How to build OpenValve

OpenValve is an open hardware project intended for makers, developers and research purposes. It is not available as a ready-to-use consumer product and must be assembled and partly printed.

### To build your own you need:
- the assembly kit + soil moisture sensor (soon available on lectronz)
- an enclosed 3D printer (capable of printing ASA without warping) + ASA filament
- 1 x 9V Alkaline Battery
- solder equipment
- basic hand tools (allen keys, pliers)
